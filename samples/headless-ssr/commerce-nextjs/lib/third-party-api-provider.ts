/**
 * @file
 * A fake 3rd party API that returns the availability of a product based on its id.
 *
 * The returned value of this fake API are random.
 * The "response time" of the API is however rigged to illustrate various scenarios:
 *  - The first and third request will respond 'fast' (<200ms) to represent the most optimistic cases
 *  - The fifth & sixth request will respond 'very slow' (>5s) to represent the worst case scenario case
 *  - The other request will respond between 500 & 1000ms.
 * Every 10 requests, the counter of requests will reset.
