# MSW Required Reading

Before creating or modifying Storybook API mocks, read these package docs:

- `packages/atomic/storybook-utils/api/README.md` (structure and naming conventions)
- `packages/atomic/storybook-utils/api/USAGE.md` (how to use MSW harnesses in stories)

These are the source of truth for `EndpointHarness`, response helpers, and supported patterns.
