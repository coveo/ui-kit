## ⚠️ Accessibility is a Priority in This Project

All code generated for this project must adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA. Accessibility is not an afterthought—it is a core requirement. By following these guidelines, we ensure our project is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## 📋 Key WCAG 2.2 Level AA Guidelines

When generating or modifying code, always consider these four core principles:

### 1. Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Provide text alternatives** for non-text content (images, icons, buttons)
- **Provide captions and alternatives** for multimedia
- **Create content** that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Make it easier** for users to see and hear content by separating foreground from background

### 2. Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Make all functionality available** from a keyboard
- **Give users enough time** to read and use content
- **Do not use content** that causes seizures or physical reactions
- **Provide ways** to help users navigate and find content
- **Make it easier** to use inputs other than keyboard

### 3. Understandable
Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

- **Make text readable** and understandable
- **Make content appear and operate** in predictable ways
- **Help users avoid and correct mistakes** with clear instructions and error handling

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- **Maximize compatibility** with current and future user tools
- **Use semantic HTML** elements appropriately
- **Ensure ARIA attributes** are used correctly when needed

## 🧩 Code Reminders for Accessibility

### HTML Reminders
- Always include appropriate semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Always add `alt` attributes to images: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">`
- Always include a language attribute in the HTML tag: `<html lang="en">`
- Always use heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) in logical, hierarchical order
- Always associate `<label>` elements with form controls or use `aria-label`
- Always include skip links for keyboard navigation
- Always ensure proper color contrast for text elements

### CSS Reminders
- Never rely solely on color to convey information
- Always provide visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Always test layouts at different zoom levels and viewport sizes
- Always use relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`) instead of fixed units where appropriate
- Never use CSS to hide content that should be available to screen readers

### JavaScript Reminders
- Always make custom interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Always manage focus when creating dynamic content
- Always use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- Always maintain logical focus order in interactive applications
- Always test with keyboard-only navigation

## Storybook Accessibility Testing

**Use Storybook stories for visual accessibility validation:**

1. **Generate story URLs** after component changes using `mcp_storybook_get-story-urls`
2. **Provide story links** for manual accessibility review
3. **Ensure all component states** are covered in stories for comprehensive a11y testing
4. **Test keyboard navigation** in Storybook's interactive environment
5. **Verify screen reader compatibility** using Storybook's accessibility addon

Stories provide isolated environments for testing:
- Focus management and keyboard navigation
- Screen reader announcements
- Color contrast in different themes
- Component behavior with assistive technologies

## IMPORTANT

Please execute pa11y and axe-core every time you make changes to the codebase to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. Additionally, use Storybook stories with the MCP tools to provide visual accessibility testing environments. This multi-layered approach will help catch issues early and maintain a high standard of accessibility throughout the project.
