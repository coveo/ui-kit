## About

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- It demonstrates usage of the `@coveo/headless/ssr` utils for Server-Side Rendering with headless.
- Although NextJS is used to demonstrate usage for convenience, the utils are not specific to NextJS/React.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
