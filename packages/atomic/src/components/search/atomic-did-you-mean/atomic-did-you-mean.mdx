Using the _Did You Mean_ component is with your search page is a best practice, especially if your index has search terms that can be misinterpreted as an error.
The relevance of the corrections improves with the size of the index, as more terms become available for comparison.

It's possible to define certain phrases or terms in an organization’s thesaurus, which will expand or replace the query expression before executing the query.
However, the _Did You Mean_ component won’t process queries expanded by the thesaurus.


### Common Use Cases
* The current query returns results, but the index has more frequently occurring terms with similar spelling, the component presents a link containing the new terms.
When clicked, the link triggers a new query using the corrected keywords.
* A soft nudge asking them if that's what they meant can direct them to the most relevant results.

## Examples

When submitting a misspelled search of "guitr" in Google it’s automatically corrected, displaying the results for "guitar" and a message indicating that the correction occurred.
