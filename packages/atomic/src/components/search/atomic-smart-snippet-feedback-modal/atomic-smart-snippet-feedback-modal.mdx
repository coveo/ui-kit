The `atomic-smart-snippet-feedback-modal` component is automatically created as a child of the `atomic-search-interface` when the `atomic-smart-snippet` component is initialized. It displays a modal dialog that allows users to provide feedback on why a smart snippet answer was not helpful.

When the modal is opened, the class `atomic-modal-opened` is added to the body, allowing further customization.

## Key Features

- **Feedback Collection**: Collects user feedback when a smart snippet answer is not helpful
- **Multiple Reasons**: Provides predefined reasons for why the answer was not useful
- **Custom Details**: Allows users to provide additional details about their feedback
- **Modal Dialog**: Displays as a modal overlay with backdrop

## Usage

This component is typically not used directly. It is automatically created and managed by the `atomic-smart-snippet` component when a user clicks the "dislike" button.

```html
<atomic-search-interface>
  <atomic-smart-snippet></atomic-smart-snippet>
</atomic-search-interface>
```
