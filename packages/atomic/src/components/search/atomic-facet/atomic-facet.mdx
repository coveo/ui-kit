This component is typically placed within the "facets" section of the layout.

You can also place facets inside an `atomic-facet-manager` component to ensure the effective functioning of DNE (Dynamic Navigation Experience).

### Display Options

The facet component supports three different display modes:

- **Checkboxes** (default): The most commonly used display, allows multiple selections
- **Links**: Single selection only, behave like navigational links
- **Boxes**: Multi-select with a more visual appearance, presents more values in compact space

### Common Use Cases

Facets are useful for large indexes because they provide multiple filters, one for every specific aspect of the content. 
Faceted navigation helps the user get an overview of the content available, helping them understand how to search for it.

## UX Best Practices

- Don’t use boxes if your facet values are long, it won’t provide a good experience for your users and you risk truncating values.
- Place facets on the left side of the search page; this is the most natural place for them and is where users expect to see them.
- Positioning facets on the right side results in lower adoption and decreases the usability of the search page.
- Adding an optional search box to a facet can help find specific values inside larger sets.
