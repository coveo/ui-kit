# UX notes

{facet} components that are slotted within an `atomic-facet-manager` are removed and reattached to the DOM by the {facet} manager.
This means that the [Stencil lifecycle](https://stenciljs.com/docs/component-lifecycle#component-lifecycle-methods) applies to the slotted {facets}.

If you [create your own custom facet component]({site-baseurl}/atomic/latest/usage/custom-web-components#custom-component-example) and slot it inside of the `atomic-facet-manager`, it will have to be able to handle the Stencil reattachment lifecycle.
Alternately, you can place your custom component outside of the `atomic-facet-manager`, in which case the Stencil lifecycle wonâ€™t apply.
