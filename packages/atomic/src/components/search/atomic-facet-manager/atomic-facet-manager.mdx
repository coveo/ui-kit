The `atomic-facet-manager` is designed to handle the removal and re-attachment of <a href="?path=/story/atomic-facet--default">facet</a> components
to the DOM.
This means that the [Stencil lifecycle](https://stenciljs.com/docs/component-lifecycle#component-lifecycle-methods) applies to the slotted facets.

If you <a href="https://docs.coveo.com/en/atomic/latest/usage/custom-web-components#custom-component-example">create your own custom facet component</a> and slot it inside of the `atomic-facet-manager`, it will have to be able to handle the Stencil reattachment lifecycle.
Alternately, you can place your custom component outside of the `atomic-facet-manager`, in which case the Stencil lifecycle won’t apply.
