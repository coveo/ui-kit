This component is typically placed within the "pagination" section of the layout.

**Note:** Use either `atomic-load-more-results` OR `atomic-pager` for pagination, but not both. These components provide alternative pagination approaches:
- `atomic-pager`: Provides traditional page-based navigation with numbered pages. It is often used along with the `atomic-results-per-page` component.
- `atomic-load-more-results`: Allows users to incrementally load additional results with a "Load More" button.



```html
<atomic-search-interface>
  ...
  <atomic-search-layout>
    ...
    <atomic-layout-section section="main">
      ...
      <atomic-layout-section section="pagination">
        
        <atomic-load-more-results></atomic-load-more-results>

      </atomic-layout-section>
    </atomic-layout-section>
  </atomic-search-layout>
</atomic-search-interface>
```

## UX Best Practices

### Usage Notes

- The Load More Results component is especially useful when you want your user to browse more results, rather than return to and refine facets or reconsider their query. 
- Users browse longer than with Load more than with Pagination.
- Load More is less effective when the items in a source are highly specific or when they require comparison.

### Use Cases and Examples

On an ecommerce site, users will view more products using a Load More button then with a Pager.
When considering designing for mobile, a Load More button is a better experience for the user.
