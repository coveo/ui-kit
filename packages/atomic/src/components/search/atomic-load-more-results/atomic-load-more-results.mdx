# UX notes

## Introduction

This component allows a user to load more results when they reach the bottom of a page, assuming there are more results.
This approach offers a smoother and more intuitive browsing experience, as thereâ€™s no "page reload."

## User Experience and Best Practices

### Usage Notes

* The Load More Results component is especially useful when you want your user to browse more results, rather than return to and refine facets or reconsider their query.
* When the items in a source are highly specific, a pager is a more appropriate component.

### Guidelines

Users browse longer than with Load more than with Pagination.
Load more is less effective when the items in a source are very specific and require comparison.

## Use Cases and Examples

On an ecommerce site, users will view more products using a Load More button then with a Pager.
When considering designing for mobile, a Load More button is a better experience for the user.
