The `atomic-search-box-query-suggestions` component displays query suggestions as the user types in the search box. It provides autocomplete functionality to help users formulate better queries.

This component is placed inside the [atomic-search-box](/docs/atomic-search-box--docs) and is included by default. You can add it manually to customize its properties.

This component should be placed within an `atomic-search-interface` component, typically in the search box area.

```html
<atomic-search-interface>
  <atomic-search-layout>
    <atomic-layout-section section="search">
      <atomic-search-box>
        <atomic-search-box-query-suggestions></atomic-search-box-query-suggestions>
      </atomic-search-box>
    </atomic-layout-section>
  </atomic-search-layout>
</atomic-search-interface>
```
