# UX notes

## Introduction

A facet allows users to drill down inside a result set by filtering the result to certain field values.
Adding an optional search box to a facet can help find specific values inside larger sets.

## User Experience and Best Practices

### Usage Notes

* Checkboxes are the most commonly used display in most cases.
* Boxes are multi-select, more visual, and able to present more values in a small space.
* Links allow the user to select only one value at a time, and behave like a normal navigational link.

### Guidelines

Don’t use boxes if your facet values are long, it won’t provide a good experience for your users and you risk truncating values.
Place facets on the left side of the search page; this is the most natural place for them and is where users expect to see them.
Positioning facets on the right side results in lower adoption and decreases the usability of the search page.

## Use Cases and Examples

Facets are useful for large indexes because they provide multiple filters, one for every specific aspect of the content.
Faceted navigation helps the user get an overview of the content available, helping them understand how to search for it.
