# UX notes

## Introduction

A facet allows users to drill down inside a result set by filtering the result to certain field values.
_Category Facets_ are browsable facets that display values in a hierarchical fashion, narrowing the available options through offering alternative starting points and sub-categories.

The Category Facet is especially useful when making fundamental decisions on a starting point in a search or browsing session.
For example, if the starting point was Clothing, available options to choose from might include t-shirts, sweaters, brands, sales, new arrivals, etc.
Each one of those options would then offer a new list of surrogate categories.

## Best Practices

### Usage Notes

* A Category Facet requires a multi-value field whose values are formatted hierarchically.
The facet will determine the filter to apply based on the current selected path of values.
This can offer a powerful navigational experience, quickly leading a user to relevant results.

  This component uses `;` to separate individual values, and the character that’s defined with the `delimiting-character` attribute to separate hierarchical levels within each value.
  Set this attribute to `|` instead of using the default, which is `;`.
  The following is an example of the recommended hierarchical formatting:

  `clothing; clothing|sale; clothing|sale|shoes; clothing|sale|shoes|kids; clothing|sale|shoes|kids|sneakers;`
* It’s only possible to select one value at a time in a category facet.
This is because they’re meant to ease navigation through their hierarchically organized content, as opposed to applying multiple hierarchical filters.

### Guidelines

It’s best practice to have hierarchies at five levels or less in depth.

## Use Cases and Examples

On an ecommerce website, a user may want to start browsing by the category _Men_, and then narrow their results to _Bottoms_, then further to _Pants_, etc.
Instead of selecting the facet value directly, this allows them to navigate hierarchically and determine the right starting point.
