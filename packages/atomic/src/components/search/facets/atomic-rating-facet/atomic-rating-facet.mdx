# UX notes

## Introduction

A facet allows users to drill down inside a result set by filtering the result to certain field values.
The _Rating Facet_ component displays a facet of the results for the current query as ratings.

## User Experience and Best Practices

* Use the Rating Facet when social proof is important in guiding the user’s decisions.
* Ratings help users understand what others think, or how they have rated the item.
* The Rating Facet only works with numeric field values.

### Guidelines

Don’t use a range that’s too large, keep it below ten.
A five star rating system is ideal; this is a common system that’s familiar to most people.

## Use Cases and Examples

On an ecommerce website, a user may want to filter their results to display only the items that have a rating of four stars or above.
