The `atomic-segmented-facet-scrollable` component wraps around one or several `atomic-segmented-facet` components to provide horizontal scrolling capabilities.

This component is useful when you have multiple segmented facets that need to be displayed horizontally but may not fit in the available space. The component automatically shows arrow buttons when the content overflows, allowing users to scroll through the facets.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Arrow Display**: Shows left and right arrow buttons only when content is scrollable
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Provides smooth horizontal scrolling animations
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different viewport sizes and content widths
- **Accessibility**: Arrow buttons are properly hidden from screen readers since they're purely decorative

## Usage

This component is typically placed within the "horizontal-facets" section of the layout. Place one or more `atomic-segmented-facet` components inside it.

```html
<atomic-search-interface>
  ...
  <atomic-search-layout>
    ...
    <atomic-layout-section section="horizontal-facets">
      <atomic-segmented-facet-scrollable>
        <atomic-segmented-facet
          field="objecttype"
          label="Object Type"
        ></atomic-segmented-facet>
        <atomic-segmented-facet
          field="author"
          label="Author"
        ></atomic-segmented-facet>
        <atomic-segmented-facet
          field="language"
          label="Language"
        ></atomic-segmented-facet>
      </atomic-segmented-facet-scrollable>
    </atomic-layout-section>
    ...
  </atomic-search-layout>
</atomic-search-interface>
```
