# atomic-breadbox

The `atomic-breadbox` component creates breadcrumbs that display a summary of the currently active facet values.
This component helps users understand and manage their current filter selections by showing them in a compact, visual format.

## Usage

```html
<atomic-breadbox></atomic-breadbox>
```

## Props

### pathLimit

Controls the display depth of the path by specifying the number of parent or ancestor breadcrumb links relative to the currently selected value.

- If the path size is equal to or less than the pathLimit, all values in the path will be displayed without truncation.
- If the path size exceeds the pathLimit, it will truncate the path by replacing the middle values with ellipses ('...').

**Type:** `number`  
**Default:** `3`  
**Minimum:** `1`
