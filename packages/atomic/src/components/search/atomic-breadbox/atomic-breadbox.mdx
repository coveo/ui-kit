Include breadcrumbs in a search page when you want users to navigate the content using facets.
For eaxmple, on an ecommerce website breadcrumbs help the users keep track of the selected filters and being able to confirm and adjust filtering encourages browsing.


## UX Best Practices

- **Field names provide context for the selected value**: displaying the field name next to the selected value clarifis which facet the breadcrumb value associated with.
In the case where there are two or less facets, remove the field name through the CSS shadow part `breadcrumb-label` if the context is clear.
