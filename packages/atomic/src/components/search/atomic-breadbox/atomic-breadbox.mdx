Include breadcrumbs in a search page when you want users to navigate the content using facets.

This component is typically placed within the "status" section of the layout.

```jsx
<atomic-search-interface>
  ...
  <atomic-search-layout>
    ...
    <atomic-layout-section section="main">
      ...
      <atomic-layout-section section="status">
        <atomic-breadbox></atomic-breadbox>
      </atomic-layout-section>
      ...
    </atomic-layout-section>
  </atomic-search-layout>
</atomic-search-interface>
```

## UX Best Practices
- **Field names provide context for the selected value**: displaying the field name next to the selected value clarifies which facet the breadcrumb value is associated with.
  - If there are only one or two facets in the page with clearly distinct values (e.g., author names and file size ranges), you can remove the field name through the `breadcrumb-label` CSS shadow part (e.g., by styling it to `display: none`).
