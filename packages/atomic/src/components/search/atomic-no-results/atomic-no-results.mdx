# UX notes

## Introduction

This component provides feedback to the user by indicating that the {query} didnâ€™t return any results and guiding them to their next action.

## User experience and best practices

### Usage notes

Used when the {query} returns no results.
Displaying additional content from this component using a `<slot>` element is also possible.
The `<slot>` element acts as a placeholder inside the {atomic} component, into which you can place your own markup to offer custom content such as messages, images, or links.

### Guidelines

Use this opportunity to provide support to your users in the form of advice and tools for {query} reformulation.
If applicable, you should promote exploration and discovery using things like top searches, featured {items}, or popular {items}.

## Use cases and examples

When displaying a "no results" message on an ecommerce site, displaying popular products that relate to a selected category can help direct the user to a relevant result.
It may also help increase sales.
