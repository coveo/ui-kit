The `atomic-no-results` component displays search tips and a "Cancel last action" button when there are no results. Any additional content slotted inside of its element will be displayed as well.

This component is typically placed within the results section of the search interface layout.
```html
<atomic-search-interface>
  ...
  <atomic-search-layout>
    ...
    <atomic-layout-section section="main">
      ...
      <atomic-layout-section section="results">

        <atomic-no-results></atomic-no-results>

      </atomic-layout-section>
    </atomic-layout-section>
  </atomic-search-layout>
</atomic-search-interface>
```

## UX best practices

- Used when the query returns no results.
- Displaying additional content from this component using a `<slot>` element is also possible.
- The `<slot>` element acts as a placeholder inside the Atomic component, into which you can place your own markup to offer custom content such as messages, images, or links.
- Use this opportunity to provide support to your users in the form of advice and tools for query reformulation.
- If applicable, you should promote exploration and discovery using things like top searches, featured items, or popular items.

### Use cases and examples

When displaying a "no results" message on an ecommerce site, displaying popular products that relate to a selected category can help direct the user to a relevant result.
It may also help increase sales.
