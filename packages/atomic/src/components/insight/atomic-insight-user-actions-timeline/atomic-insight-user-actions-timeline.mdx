The `atomic-insight-user-actions-timeline` component displays all the actions performed by a user around the time they created a case.
The actions are grouped into multiple sessions, including the session during which the case was created,
the sessions preceding the case creation, and the sessions following the case creation.

**Note:** This is an internal component used by the `atomic-insight-user-actions-modal`. Do not use directly.

## Behavior

The component automatically organizes user actions into three session groups:

1. **Active Session**: The session during which the case was created (always visible)
2. **Following Sessions**: Sessions that occurred after the case creation (collapsed by default)
3. **Preceding Sessions**: Sessions that occurred before the case creation (collapsed by default)

Users can toggle the visibility of following and preceding sessions using the expand/collapse buttons.

## Error States

The component displays an error screen when:
- No user actions are available for the specified user
- The user actions fetch fails (e.g., access denied)
- The timeline data is unavailable
