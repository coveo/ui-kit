## Usage

This component should not be needed if you use an interface, as those will automatically create an `atomic-aria-live` component. However, you might want to be able to add regions and messages to that aria-live region from another custom component. You can do so using the `findAriaLive` event.

The `atomic-aria-live` component listens for `atomic/accessibility/findAriaLive` events dispatched on the document. When such an event is received, it sets itself as the `element` property in the event details, allowing other components to interact with it programmatically.

To use this from a custom component, you can dispatch the event and then call methods on the returned element:

```typescript
// Find the aria-live component
const event = new CustomEvent('atomic/accessibility/findAriaLive', {
  detail: {}
});
document.dispatchEvent(event);
const ariaLiveElement = event.detail.element;

// Register a new region and update its message
ariaLiveElement?.registerRegion('my-region', false); // false = polite, true = assertive
ariaLiveElement?.updateMessage('my-region', 'This is an announcement', false);
```
