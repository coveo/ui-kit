# atomic-focus-trap

The `atomic-focus-trap` component is an internal utility that manages focus within modal dialogs and popovers. When active, it ensures keyboard navigation stays within the trap and hides sibling elements from assistive technologies.

## Properties

- `active` (boolean): Whether the focus trap is active.
- `source` (HTMLElement): The element to focus when the trap becomes inactive.
- `container` (HTMLElement): The container to hide when the trap is inactive.
- `shouldHideSelf` (boolean): Whether to hide the element when inactive.
- `scope` (Element): The common ancestor for determining accessible elements.

## Notes

- Uses the `inert` attribute when supported for better accessibility.
- Falls back to `aria-hidden` for older browsers.
- Respects `aria-live` regions which must remain accessible.
