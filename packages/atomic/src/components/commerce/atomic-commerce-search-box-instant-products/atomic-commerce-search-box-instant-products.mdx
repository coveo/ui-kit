## Usage
This component is placed inside the [atomic-commerce-search-box](/docs/atomic-commerce-search-box--docs) to display instant products as the user types.

By default, `atomic-commerce-search-box-instant-products` is not included in the default `atomic-commerce-search-box`.

This component needs the `atomic-commerce-search-box-query-suggestions` component to be present in the same `atomic-commerce-search-box` component.
```html
<atomic-commerce-search-box>
  <atomic-commerce-search-box-query-suggestions></atomic-commerce-search-box-query-suggestions>
  <atomic-commerce-search-box-instant-products></atomic-commerce-search-box-instant-products>
</atomic-commerce-search-box>
```

## Examples
<Stories title={""}/>

## Reference
