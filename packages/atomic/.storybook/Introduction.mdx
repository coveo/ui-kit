# Welcome to the Coveo Atomic Storybook
This Storybook showcases interactive documentation for the [Coveo Atomic library](https://docs.coveo.com/en/atomic/latest)

Here you can find guides for using Atomic web components for each of the solutions which Coveo offers:

* [Commerce](/docs/commerce-introduction--docs)
* [Insight](/docs/insight-introduction--docs)
* [Recommendation](/docs/recommendations-introduction--docs)
* [Search](/docs/search-introduction--docs)

You can find information about components which are used across all solutions in [Common](/docs/common-introduction--docs).

If you are looking to integrate Coveo with a web framework, Coveo offers wrappers for [React](https://docs.coveo.com/en/atomic/latest/usage/frameworks/atomic-react-wrapper/) and [Angular](https://docs.coveo.com/en/atomic/latest/usage/frameworks/atomic-angular-wrapper/).
