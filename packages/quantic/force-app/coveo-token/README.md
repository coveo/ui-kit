# Coveo Token Provider

The Coveo Token Provider uses [Coveo For Salesforce](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1104/coveo-for-salesforce/what-s-coveo-for-salesforce) and its configuration to generate search tokens.

It requires that you have Coveo For Salesforce installed and configured.
Refer to our [documentation](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1158/coveo-for-salesforce/getting-started-with-coveo-for-salesforce) for more details.
