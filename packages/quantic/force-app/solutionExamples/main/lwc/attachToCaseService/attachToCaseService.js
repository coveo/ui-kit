/**
 * This file provides stubbed implementations for attaching, detaching, and retrieving results associated to a case.
 *
 * These methods are meant to be replaced in real implementations with actual Apex calls to the AttachToCaseController.
 *
 * Example of what a real implementation might look like (commented out below for reference):
 *
 * ```js
 * // @ts-ignore
 * import AttachToCase from '@salesforce/apex/CoveoV2.AttachToCaseController.AuraAttachToCase';
 * // @ts-ignore
 * import DetachFromCase from '@salesforce/apex/CoveoV2.AttachToCaseController.AuraDetachFromCase';
 * // @ts-ignore
 * import getAttachedResults from '@salesforce/apex/CoveoV2.AttachToCaseController.getAttachedResults';
 *
 * export function attachToCase(resultToAttach) {
 *   return AttachToCase(resultToAttach);
 * }
 *
 * export function detachFromCase(resultToDetach) {
 *   return DetachFromCase(resultToDetach);
 * }
 *
 * export function getAllAttachedResults(caseId) {
 *   return getAttachedResults({ caseId });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * See documentation for details on how to override this file with a real implementation.
