## Deploy the Quantic Examples Community

Example components are available as a Salesforce community (Digital Experience) allowing you to experiment with Quantic components.

1. To create a community named `Quantic Examples`, run:

    ```bash
    sfdx force:community:create -u LWC -n "Quantic Examples" -p examples -t "Build Your Own"
    ```

2. To deploy Quantic and the example components, run:

    ```bash
    sfdx force:source:deploy -u LWC -p force-app/main,force-app/examples
    ```

3. To deploy the community, run:

    ```bash
    sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -u LWC -d ./quantic-examples-community -w 5
    ```

4. To publish the community, run:

    ```bash
    sfdx force:community:publish -u LWC -n "Quantic Examples" --json
    ```

    The community URL will appear in the console output.

5. Copy the `cypress/plugins/config/examples-community.json.example` to `cypress/plugins/config/examples-community.json`.
   
6. Update the `cypress/plugins/config/examples-community.json` file with the community URL like this:

    ```json
    {
      "env": {
        "examplesUrl": "https://your-salesforce-instance.force.com/examples"
      }
    }
    ```
