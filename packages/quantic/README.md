### Deploy the Quantic code

- Run this command from the command line. `sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default`.

## Testing

### Deploy the Quantic Examples Community

Example components are available as a Salesforce community (Digital Experience) allowing you to experiment with Quantic components.

To setup the community in the `LWC` scratch org, run:

```bash
npm run setup:examples
```

This script creates, configures, and deploys everything required to have fully working examples. The community URL is provided at the end of the script output, as in the following example:

```
...

The 'Quantic Examples' community is ready, you can access it at the following URL:
https://your-salesforce-scratch-org-instance.force.com/examples

To open Cypress, run:
npm run e2e:watch
```

Once the community has been deployed, you can deploy the `main` or `example` components only when needed. To do so, run:

```bash
npm run deploy:main
npm run deploy:examples
```

### Run Cypress for Quantic Components

**Note** Before attempting to run [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io) tests, make sure the `Quantic Examples` community is deployed as described in the previous section.

To learn how to add tests, see [adding tests](./docs/adding-tests.md).

- All the tests will need to be under folder `cypress/integration`.

To open Cypress in browser mode, run:

```bash
npm run e2e:watch
```

To run Cypress tests directly in your console, run:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

To get the [detailed report](./docs/detailed-reporting.md), run:

```bash
npm run e2e:detailed
```

## Use Quantic From Source

- `npm run build`
- `sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default`
