   * This is an advanced option that you should only set if you need to proxy Coveo case assist requests through your own
   * server. In most cases, you should not set this option.
   *
   * By default, no proxy is used and the Coveo case assist requests are sent directly to the Coveo platform through the
   * [organization endpoint](https://docs.coveo.com/en/mcc80216) resolved from the `organizationId` and
   * `environment` values provided in your engine configuration (i.e., `https://<organizationId>.org.coveo.com` or
   * `https://<organizationId>.org<environment>.coveo.com`, if the `environment` values is specified and different from
   * `prod`).
   *
   * If you set this option, you must also implement the following proxy endpoints on your server, otherwise the case assist
   * engine will not work properly:
   *
   * - `POST` `/classify` to proxy requests to [`POST` `https://<organizationId>.org<environment|>.coveo.com/rest/organizations/<organizationId>/caseassists/<caseAssistId>/classify`](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3430/api-reference/customer-service-api#tag/Case-Assist/operation/postClassify)
   * - `POST` `/documents/suggest` to proxy requests to [`POST` `https://<organizationId>.org<environment|>.coveo.com/rest/organizations/<organizationId>/caseassists/<caseAssistId>/documents/suggest`](https://docs.coveo.com/en/3430/api-reference/customer-service-api#tag/Case-Assist/operation/getSuggestDocument)
